Power BI Assignment 5:-
  
  1. Explain DAX.
  
  Ans: DAX, which stands for Data Analysis Expressions, is a formula language used in Microsoft Power BI, Power Pivot, and Analysis Services 
       Tabular models. It is specifically designed for working with and manipulating data within these tools. DAX is similar to Excel formulas, 
       but it offers additional functionality and capabilities for data analysis and calculations.
 
       a.DAX functions and expressions are used to create formulas that perform various tasks, such as aggregating data, filtering data,
         performing calculations, and creating new calculated columns or measures.
  
       b.Aggregation Functions: DAX includes functions such as SUM, AVERAGE, MIN, MAX, and COUNT, which are used to perform calculations on a 
         set of values within a column or table.
   
       c.Filter Functions: DAX provides functions like FILTER, CALCULATE, and ALL, which allow for the creation of dynamic filters based on specific 
         conditions or criteria.
  
       d.Time Intelligence Functions: DAX includes a set of functions like DATEADD, TOTALYTD, SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR, and many others, specifically designed.
